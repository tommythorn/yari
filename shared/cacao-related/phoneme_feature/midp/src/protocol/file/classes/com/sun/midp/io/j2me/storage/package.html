 Internal interfaces to file storage for MIDlet suite code, RMS data, and
 public keys. See storage.h for information on the native interface.
<p>
 To aid in porting and to simplify code, this package presents a flat
 file system, since not all devices support directory hierarchies and
 recursing through directories is complex.</p>
<p>
 The installation and RMS code needs to be group the files of a suite together,
 however this can be done without directories by just not using file
 separators when building a full filename. Second, a method is provided to get
 a list of full filenames that begin with given string, instead of a list a
 partial filenames in a directory.</p>
<p>
 The Java code on some platforms may need to access files outside of the
 storage directory, but this code does not build or parse filenames,
 the filenames come from either the command line or a configuration file and
 used as-is. Since the code to access files for a suite builds filenames
 and the storage root for a suite contains the storage root directory,
 filenames for this package are direct system file names, so any file on the
 system can be accessed without the knowledge of file separators.</p>
<p>
 To aid in porting to file systems that are not case sensitive, like Win32,
 the method that converts filenames from Unicode to ASCII, prefixes uppercase
 characters with a "#".</p>
