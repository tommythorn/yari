The Game API package provides a series of classes that enable the
development of rich gaming content for wireless devices.
<p>Wireless devices have minimal processing power, so much of the API is
intended to improve performance by minimizing the amount of work done in
Java; this approach also has the added benefit of reducing application
size.&nbsp; The API's are structured to provide considerable freedom when
implementing them, thereby permitting the extensive use of native code,
hardware acceleration and device-specific image data formats as needed.
<p>The API uses the standard low-level graphics classes from MIDP (Graphics,
Image, etc.) so that the high-level Game API classes can be used in conjunction
with graphics primitives.&nbsp; For example, it would be possible to render
a complex background using the Game API and then render something on top
of it using graphics primitives such as drawLine, etc.
<p>Methods that modify the state of Layer, LayerManager, Sprite, and TiledLayer
objects generally do not have any immediately visible side effects. Instead,
this state is merely stored within the object and is used during subsequent
calls to the paint() method. This approach is suitable for gaming applications
where there is a game cycle within which objects' states are updated, and
where the entire screen is redrawn at the end of every game cycle.
<h2>
API Overview</h2>
The API is comprised of five classes:
<h3>
GameCanvas</h3>
This class is a subclass of LCDUI's Canvas and provides the basic 'screen'
functionality for a game.&nbsp; In addition to the methods inherited from
Canvas, this class also provides game-centric features such the ability
to query the current state of the game keys and synchronous graphics flushing;
these features simplify game development and improve performance.
<h3>
Layer</h3>
The Layer class represents a visual element in a game such as a Sprite
or a TiledLayer.&nbsp; This abstract class forms the basis for the Layer
framework and provides basic attributes such as location, size, and visibility.
<h3>
LayerManager</h3>
For games that employ several Layers, the LayerManager simplifies game
development by automating the rendering process.&nbsp; It allows the developer
set a view window that represents the user's view of the game.&nbsp; The
LayerManager automatically renders the game's Layers to implement the desired
view.
<h3>
Sprite</h3>
A Sprite is basic animated Layer that can display one of several graphical
frames.&nbsp; The frames are all of equal size and are provided by a single
Image object.&nbsp; In addition to animating the frames sequentially, a
custom sequence can also be set to animation the frames in an arbitrary
manner.&nbsp; The Sprite class also provides various transformations (flip
and rotation) and collision detection methods that simplify the implementation
of a game's logic.
<h3>
TiledLayer</h3>
This class enables a developer to create large areas of graphical content
without the resource usage that a large Image object would require.&nbsp;
It is a comprised of a grid of cells, and each cell can display one of
several tiles that are provided by a single Image object.&nbsp; Cells can
also be filled with animated tiles whose corresponding pixel data can be
changed very rapidly; this feature is very useful for animating large groups
of cells such as areas of water.
