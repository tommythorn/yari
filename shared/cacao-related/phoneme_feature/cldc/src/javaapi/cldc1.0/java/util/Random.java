/**
 * An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of
 * pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is
 * modified using a linear congruential formula. (See Donald Knuth,
 * <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2</i>, Section 3.2.1.)
 * <p>
 * If two instances of <code>Random</code> are created with the same
 * seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made for each, they
 * will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to
 * guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the
 * class <tt>Random</tt>. Java implementations must use all the algorithms
 * shown here for the class <tt>Random</tt>, for the sake of absolute
 * portability of Java code. However, subclasses of class <tt>Random</tt>
 * are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the
 * general contracts for all the methods.
 * <p>
 * The algorithms implemented by class <tt>Random</tt> use a
 * <tt>protected</tt> utility method that on each invocation can supply
 * up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
