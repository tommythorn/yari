/**
 * Implements a SMS message for the SMS message connection. This class
 * contains methods for manipulating message objects and their contents.
 * Messages can be composed of data and an address. MessageObject contains 
 * methods that can get and set the data and the address parts of a message 
 * separately. The data part can be either
 * text or binary format. The address part has the format:
 * <p> 
 * <code>sms://[<em>phone_number</em>:][<em>port_number</em>]</code>
 * <p>
 * and represents the address of a port that can accept or 
 * receive SMS messages. 
 *<p>
 * <code>MessageObject</code>s are instantiated when they are received from the
 * {@link com.sun.tck.wma.MessageConnection MessageConnection} 
 * or by using the {@link MessageConnection#newMessage(String type)
 * MessageConnection.newMessage} message factory. Instances are freed when they
 * are garbage-collected or when they go out of scope.
