    <title>JSR 205/120 cleanup on midlet removal</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    This package notifies the Wireless Messaging Subsystem (JSR 205 or 120)
    when a midlet is removed, so that it can perform any cleanup, 
    like deleteing messages.

    <ul>
      <li>com.sun.midp.wma.WMACleanupMonitor</li>

    </ul>
   <p> The function of this class is to call a native function,
       when a MIDletSuite terminates. The native function will
       perform any cleanup that is required, eg: delete any messages
       left unread by the MIDletSuite.
       This class implements the 
       {@link com.sun.midp.main.MIDletProxyListListener} interface and is
       thus notified whenever a MIDletSuite is installed or removed.
       The methods here are called at appropriate times. 
   </p>
   <p>
       At startup <code>init</code> is called by
       {@link com.sun.midp.main.MIDletSuiteLoader} to initialize any
       necessary cleanup handling when the application exits. 
   </p>
   <p>
       When a MIDlet is about to created the
       <code>midletAdded</code> method is called, but it is a no-op here. 
   </p>
   <p>
       When a MIDlet state is updated the
       <code>midletUpdated</code> method is called, but it is a no-op here. 
   </p>
   <p>
       When an error occurs while starting a  MIDlet the
       <code>midletStartError</code> method is called, but it is a no-op here. 
   </p>
   <p>
       When a MIDlet has been destroyed the
       <code>midletRemoved</code> method is called and it calls a native
       method to delete any unread messages in the inbox.
   </p>
   Note: The JSR 205 specification requires that unread messages not be
   deleted. The deletion will happen only if built with DELETE_WMA_MSGS = true.
