    <p>This is the optimized implementation for WMA 2.0, which provides
      classes that allow Java applications to access SMS functionality
      on a mobile device.</p>
    <p>The classes in this package support the sending and receiving of SMS messages.
       The classes in this package,
      {@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.Protocol Protocol}, 
      {@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.MessageObject MessageObject},
      {@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.TextObject TextObject},
      {@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.BinaryObject BinaryObject} and
      {@link com.sun.midp.io.j2me.sms.TextEncoder TextEncoder} define
      this implementation. <tt>MessageObject</tt> defines the
      implementation of the SMS message. <tt>TextObject</tt> and <tt>BinaryObject</tt>
      extend <tt>MessageObject</tt> and represent the two possible types of SMS
      messages. Text messages can be enocded as GSM 7-bit text or UCS2 characters.
      The <tt>TextEncoder</tt> class provides an encoder and decoder for these two
      types of encodings. <tt>Protocol</tt> defines the
      implementation of the SMS message connection. <tt>Protocol</tt> interfaces
      with the platform provided SMS services. It makes native calls to
      open, close and send messages.
      This connection is to a
      low-level transport mechanism which can be any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a datagram short message peer-to-peer (SMPP) protocol to a service
	center to satisfy a network-based solution
      </li>
      <li>a <tt>comm</tt> connection to a mobile device that understands AT-commands</li>
      <li>a native SMS stack for proprietary implementations</li>
      <li>a loop back implementation; that is, anything that is sent will be
	automatically received. This implementation is provided for
	testing purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connection and Message Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>Connections can be made in server mode or in client mode.
      In server mode, messages can be sent or received. In client mode, messages
      can be sent only. Applications can treat
      sending and receiving independently. </p>

    <p>To receive messages, the application can open the connection by passing
      a string containing a local port to the <tt>Connector.open</tt> method. A
      <tt>MessageConnection</tt> object is returned, on which the message can be
      received. If there are no messages in the queue, the <tt>receive()</tt>
      method will block until one arrives. When a message has been received,
      methods are available in the <tt>MessageObject</tt> class for retrieving
      its address and data parts. Calling the <tt>close()</tt> method closes the
      connection.</p>


    <p>To send messages, the application will either obtain an existing
      <tt>Message</tt> object or use the <tt>newMessage</tt> factory method to
      create one. If the application creates a <tt>Message</tt> object,
      methods are available in the <tt>MessageObject</tt> class for setting
      its address and data
      parts. The application can open a connection by passing a string containing
      a fully-qualified SMS URL address (phone number and port number) to the
      <tt>Connector.open</tt> method. A <tt>MessageConnection</tt>
      object is returned, on which the message can be sent. Calling the
      <tt>close()</tt> method closes the connection.</p>



    <h2>Package Specification</h2>
    <p>The classes in this package need access to classes in the optional
      <tt>javax.microedition.io</tt> package, the CLDC
      implementation (<tt>com.sun.cldc.*</tt>), and the MIDP
      implementation (<tt>com.sun.midp.*</tt>).
      <p>This package is also dependent on <tt>javax.microedition.io</tt> for the
	definition of <tt>Connector.open</tt> (the CLDC-definition of
	the Generic Connection Framework).
