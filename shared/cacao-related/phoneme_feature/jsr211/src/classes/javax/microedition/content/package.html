<P>The Content Handler API and execution model allow an application to
  invoke registered J2ME and non-Java applications by URL, by content
  type, or by content handler ID.  Content handlers can
  chain to other content handlers to respond to invocations.
  The classes of the API are shown below:

<IMG SRC="doc-files/chapi-hier.gif"
     NAME="chapi-arch" BORDER=1 width=767 height=584>

<p>The functions of content handler classes are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.Registry} &nbsp; - 
    invokes, registers, unregisters and queries content handlers</li>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler} &nbsp; - 
    provides the details 
    of a registration and to handle requests to an application </li>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.Invocation} &nbsp; - 
    contains the parameters passed to and returned from a content
    handler and used to select a content handler to invoke</li>
  <li> {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandlerServer} &nbsp; - 
    processes requests to handle content</li>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.RequestListener} &nbsp; - 
    notifies the content handler of pending requests</li>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.ResponseListener} &nbsp; - 
    notifies the application of pending responses</li>
  <li> {@link javax.microedition.content.ActionNameMap} &nbsp; - 
    maps actions to action names</li>
  <li>{@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandlerException} &nbsp; - 
    reports content handler errors</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications use CHAPI in two ways, as an invoking application or as
  a content handler application.  The invoking application is primarily
  concerned with the functions of the
  {@link javax.microedition.content.Registry Registry} and
  {@link javax.microedition.content.Invocation Invocation} classes.

  As a client, the application makes requests to display or act on
  some content.  The application makes a request by supplying
  parameters that identifies the content by URL or the content
  type, or the ID of the content handler, and possibly an
  action to perform. 
  If the application needs to know when a request is complete or to get
  a result it can require a response from the content handler.

  The application creates an <code>Invocation</code> instance and
  initializes it with the parameters.  The application calls the
  <code>Registry.invoke</code> method to start the request.
  Only if the invoking application is expecting a result does it need
  to retrieve the response using <code>Registry.getResponse</code>.
  The application can register a listener with
  <code>Registry.setListener</code> to be notified when the response
  is available. 

<p>A more advanced client application may want to use the
  detailed information about content handlers stored in 
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler ContentHandler}
  objects including the types, suffixes, and actions, or information
  about the content handler application including its authorization,
  application name and version, and content handler ID.
  If the application allows the user to choose the action 
  to be performed, it should use the handler's 
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ActionNameMap}s to get
  locale appropriate action names.

<p>As a server, the content handler application responds to invocation
  requests from clients.
  The content handler application uses the methods of 
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandlerServer ContentHandlerServer}
  and {@link javax.microedition.content.Invocation}.
  New requests are retrieved from the
  <code>ContentHandlerServer.getRequest</code> method.
  The content handler can register a listener with
  <code>ContentHandlerServer.setListener</code> to be notified when new
  requests are available.  The content handler uses the parameters in
  the <code>Invocation</code> to process the request. If a URL was
  supplied, the content can be retrieved with the
  <code>Invocation.open</code> method using the Generic Connection
  Framework.  The content handler uses the URL, type, and action
  to determine how it should act on the content.  When the content
  handler is done with each request it returns updated parameters and
  arguments and a status with the
  <code>ContentHandlerServer.finish</code> method.

<p>A more advanced content handler application can both be a
  client and a server. Methods on the
  {@link javax.microedition.content.Registry Registry} are used for
  the advanced functions.
  New requests can be chained to previous requests with
  the <code>invoke</code> method.
  The content handler may restrict access and visibility to itself
  during registration.
  An detailed example is provided in Appendix A.
</p>

<H2>Implementation Requirements</H2>
<ul>
  <li> The system property <code>microedition.chapi.version</code> can be
    used to determine whether   
    CHAPI is implemented, and if it is, the version number.
    If this specification  
    is implemented in a Java runtime environment, the property
    <code>microedition.chapi.version</code> MUST  
    have the value <tt>"1.0"</tt> as returned from the
    <code>java.lang.System.getProperty</code> method. </li>

  <li>Support is required for the URL scheme "<code>http</code>",
    the <code>javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection</code> interface and
    corresponding protocol.</li>

  <li>The {@link javax.microedition.content.Invocation} class and 
    invocation mechanism MUST support passing and returning arguments
    and data totaling at least 16384 bytes. 
    Each character of a String is counted as two bytes.
    It must be able to pass and return at least 10 arguments in the
    arguments array.
  </li>

  <li>
    Content handler registrations that are successful MUST be preserved
    across soft and hard restarts of the device software including
    unexpected power interruptions.</li>

  <li>
    The security policy of the Java runtime environment MUST be used
    to enforce limitations on access to content using CHAPI. 
    For MIDP, permissions and access control must be the same
    as though <code>Connector.open</code> were used to access the content.
  </li>
</ul>

<H2><a name="provisioning">Installing Content Handlers</a> </H2>
<P>Content handlers may be installed on the device either before they are needed 
  or when they are needed. The content handler API can be used to trigger the 
  installation process to install the content handlers on the device. For at least 
  one downloadable application packaging type supported by the device, the CHAPI implementation 
  MUST provide and register a content handler to perform the installation. Typically, 
  this includes <code>application/java-archive</code>.</p>

<p>An application can invoke CHAPI with the URL of an application
  package.
  The appropriate installation process for the device MUST be used to
  attempt to install the content handler.
  The installation MUST include all of the required security 
  and user prompts as specified in the appropriate profile and
  download specification. 
  If the installation process fails for any reason,
  including the user's decision to cancel the installation, 
  then the Invocation will fail with the Invocation.CANCELLED status. 
  The status response must be delivered to the invoking application,
  if required in the request. </p>

<h2>Interacting with the Application Life Cycle</h2>
<p> Content handlers are applications and are subject to the same
  security, integrity, installation, upgrade, and other requirements
  as any other application in the applicable Java runtime
  environment. Authentication of applications and application classes  
  MUST conform to the requirements of the applicable Java runtime
  environment.
</p> 
<p> Each Java runtime environment has its own application packaging
  and runtime requirements.  
  Each content handler application MUST conform to these requirements.
  Each Java runtime specifies how applications are uniquely identified,
  for example, by a classname of the application class.
  For the MIDP Profile, a content handler MUST be packaged as a MIDlet
  suite and each content handler MUST implement the MIDlet life
  cycle.
  It is NOT necessary for the content handler to be registered as a
  user visible MIDlet with a <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute.
  If the content handler MIDlet should be selectable by the user then 
  the <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute must be supplied.
</p>
<p> Installation and removal of content handlers utilizes the normal
  mechanisms of the Java runtime environment.
  During installation, any content handlers MUST be registered 
  using the attributes defined in the application packaging.
  Typically, they will be present in an application descriptor or JAR
  manifest. When a content handler  
  application is removed, all of the static and dynamic registrations
  of the content handler application MUST be released.</p> 

<h2>Handling Display Transitions - Foreground and Background</h2>

<p> A goal of the Content Handler API is to promote a smooth or
  seamless user experience between the invoking application and
  content handler. Typically, if the invoking application has a user
  interface, one of its screens will be displayed to the user (that
  is, it will be in the foreground). If a user action causes an
  Invocation then the next screen the user sees should be the
  content handler for that invocation.

  If a foreground content handler finishes with an invocation that
  requires a response to the calling application that had the
  foreground immediately before the content handler was invoked, and
  there are no other requests buffered or being processed from the
  same calling application, then the foreground is returned to the
  calling application.

<p>If there is a conflict between foreground transitions and
  external events or explicit user actions, then the external events
  or user actions should take precedence.

<h2>Static Registration of Content Handlers</h2>

<P> Content handler registration can, and generally should, be handled
  during the installation of the application. The following attributes
  can be included in the JAR manifest of the application.
  Each Java runtime environment may define their own application
  packaging extensions. For MIDP, the attributes can be included in
  the Java Application Descriptor (JAD).

  If the attributes are present, they MUST be used by the installation
  process to register the content handlers.  If the application is
  being upgraded from a previous version then static registrations
  that are not replaced by new registrations are removed.

  See the <A href="#jad">Example of MIDlet Suite Java
  Application Descriptor</A> section. </P>

<p>
  Each content handler is uniquely identified by an ID.
  Content handler and application IDs MUST NOT contain control
  characters (U+0000 thru U+001F) or spaces (U+00020).
  The ID for content handlers is supplied in the
  <CODE>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> attribute.
  If an ID is not supplied then a
  default ID MUST be generated by the implementation.
  The ID MUST NOT be equal to any other registered handler
  ID. Every other ID MUST NOT be a prefix of this ID.
  The ID MUST NOT be a prefix of any other registered ID.
  If the ID conflicts with another ID the installation MUST fail.</p>

<p>
  Each static content handler registration contains the following
  information. Fields are separated using Unicode comma ("," = U+002C).
  Whitespace is deleted from the beginning and end of each value where
  whitespace consists of sequences of one or more Unicode
  horizontal tab (HT = U+0009) or space (" " = U+0020) characters.
  Each registration consists of information from a
  <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute and optional
  attributes 
  <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;</code>,
  <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID: &lt;ID&gt;</code>, and
  <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access</code>.
  All of the attributes for a registration have the same value of 
  <code>&lt;n&gt;</code>.

  The numeric value for <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> starts at 1 and MUST
  use consecutive ordinal numbers for additional entries. 
  The attributes are:
  <code>
    <pre>
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;: &lt;classname&gt;, &lt;type(s)&gt;, &lt;suffix(es)&gt;, &lt;action(s)&gt;, &lt;locale(s)&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt;: &lt;localized action names&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID: &lt;ID&gt;
MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-Access: &lt;ID(s)&gt;
    </pre>
  </code>

    <P> <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> - Attribute for
      registrations.  
      Multiple registrations can be provided in an application.
      The numeric value for <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> starts at 1 and
      MUST use consecutive ordinal numbers for additional entries.
      The first missing entry terminates the list.

      locale.
      The locale string should be properly formatted as defined in
      class {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler}.
       
      If the corresponding <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
      attribute references this locale attribute then 
      there MUST be an action name for each action in the
      corresponding <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> 
      attribute.
      If the number of action names does not match the number of
      actions, then the installation MUST fail.
      If there are multiple action names, separate them with a comma 
      ("," = U+002C). Action names may contain embedded whitespace.
      Leading and trailing whitespace is deleted from each action. 
      If a locale attribute is present but is not referenced by a
      <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute then it is
      not used for the registration.

<h3>Using the parsed values to register</h3>
<P> The values parsed from the attributes are used to register the
  content handler.
  If there are multiple types, suffixes, actions, or locales, the
  order is significant; the values must appear in the same order 
  when passed to the <tt>Registry.register</tt> method.
  Each locale string and the sequence of actions and action names in each
  <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-&lt;locale&gt</code> attribute
  are used to make a new
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ActionNameMap ActionNameMap}.
  The arrays of types, suffixes, actions, action name maps, ID, and
  access controls are used to
  {@link javax.microedition.content.Registry#register register} the
  classname as a content handler.

<h3>Access Restrictions  and Application IDs</h3>
<p>Content Handlers can control whether they are visible to and can be
  invoked by other applications and content handlers.  The ID of the
  invoking application is matched against the list of IDs that are
  allowed access to the handler.
<p>Note that the invoking application or content handler provides its
  own ID. The veracity of the ID can be cross checked with the
  authority information that provided for content handlers and invoking
  applications.  If there is no authority information then the ID
  cannot be trusted.

<p>Each Java runtime environment MUST
  provide a mechanism to associate an ID with each application.
  If an ID is not provided, then a default value must be provided.
  For MIDP, the default value is defined below. 

<h3>Content Handlers and the Mobile Information Device Profile </h3>
<p>
  For the MIDP Profile, the implementation MUST support download
  and installation of MIDlet suites that include content handlers.
  The implementation MUST provide and register content handler(s) to
  perform the installation for the type 
  <code>text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</code> and may support the type
  <code>application/java-archive</code> for JAR-only installation.

<p>During the installation of a MIDlet suite, each content handler
  MUST be registered using the attributes defined in the Java
  Application Descriptor and/or in the Manifest.  
  For untrusted application, attributes in the JAD override
  corresponding attributes in the Manifest.

  For trusted applications, according to the MIDP specification, if
  attributes appear in both the JAD and manifest then the
  corresponding attribute values MUST be equal.</p>

<p>Content handlers MUST be installable using the MIDP OTA installation
  mechanism.
  Any failure related to content handler registration attributes
  or incorrect or invalid information related to the MIDlet suite
  must cause the installation to fail.
  If the <code>MIDlet-Install-Notify</code> attribute defined by MIDP OTA
  is present, then an installation status report MUST be sent. The
  installation notifications are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>938 Content handler conflicts with other
	   handlers</code><br>
      This CHAPI specific notification is sent
      if there is a conflict between the ID of any handler in the MIDlet
      suite being installed and handlers of existing MIDlet suites so
      the required content handler registrations cannot be
      performed, then the installation MUST fail.  
    </li>

    <li><code>939 Content handler install failed</code> <br>
      This CHAPI specific notification is sent
      if any of the content handler specific attributes are missing or
      cannot be parsed correctly or have values that are not valid to
      register the content handler then the installation must fail.
      This includes at least the values for types, suffixes, IDs, and
      actions.
    </li>
    <li><code>910 Application authorization failure</code><br>
      This MIDP OTA defined notification is sent
      if there are static registration attributes present but the
      permission <code>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</code> 
      is not requested or not granted.
    </li>
    <li><code>905 Attribute Mismatch</code><br>
      This MIDP OTA defined notification is sent if an attribute
      value in the application descriptor is not equal to the value of
      the corresponding attribute in the manifest.
    </li>
  </ul>


<p>
  If the content handler or application ID is not provided by the
  application then the implementation is required to provide a value.
  The default ID value is formed as the concatenation of the value of
  the <code>MIDlet-Vendor</code> attribute followed by a hyphen ("-" =
  U+002D) and the value of the <code>MIDlet-Name</code> attribute
  followed by a hyphen ("-" = U+002D) and the <code>classname</code>.
  All spaces (" " = U+0020) must be translated
  to underscore ("_" = U+005F).</p>

<p>
  The <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> attribute contains the
  content handler ID.
  If the MIDlet suite is trusted, then this attribute and value must be 
  present in both the manifest and application descriptor and
  the values must be the equal or it must not appear at all.
  If not present in the application descriptor or manifest, the
  implementation MUST supply a default ID as defined above
  using the classname from the <code>MicroEdition-Handler-&lt;n&gt;</code>
  attribute.

<p>
  MIDP applications that do not register as content handlers
  need an application ID to be allowed access to restricted content
  handlers.
  The <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;-ID</code> attribute contains the
  application ID for the MIDlet registered with the 
  <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute.
  When the application has gained access to the Registry the ID is
  available using the
  {@link javax.microedition.content.Registry#getID Registry.getID} method.
  If the MIDlet suite is trusted, then this attribute and value must be 
  present in both the manifest and application descriptor and
  the values must be the equal or it must not appear at all.
  If an ID is not provided, the implementation MUST supply a default ID
  as defined above using the <code>classname</code> in the
  <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The user friendly application name MUST be provided by 
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler#getAppName
  ContentHandler.getAppName}.
  If the content handler's classname is also registered as a 
  MIDlet using a 
  <tt>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</tt> attribute then the application name is the 
  <tt>name</tt> (first) value of the attribute, otherwise, the
  application name is the value of the <tt>MIDlet-Name</tt> attribute.

<p>Updates to content handlers are treated the same as updates to any
  MIDlet suite.  The updated content handlers MUST be successfully
  registered.  If there are any dynamic registrations, then they MUST
  be retained across the upgrade unless superceded by a new static
  registration for the same classname.</p>

<p>A trusted MIDlet suite MUST request and be granted the
  <tt>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</tt> 
  permission to perform either static or dynamic registrations
  consistent with the device's security policy.
  The <code>Registry.register</code> 
  method MUST throw a <code>java.lang.SecurityException</code>
  if the permission is not granted.</p>
  The permission, <tt>javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler</tt>,
  for registering content handlers SHOULD be included in the 
  <tt>auto-invocation</tt>
  function group as defined in the MIDP Recommended Security
  Policy. The policy allows an untrusted application to register
  handlers with a user prompt each time (oneshot). For trusted
  applications, the user can also choose blanket and session
  interaction modes.

<p>The MIDP specification defines the concept of a Trusted MIDlet
  suite in which 
  the AMS is able to authenticate the application. The mechanism
  defined as "Trusted MIDlet Suites Using X.509 PKI" is one mechanism
  for authenticating a MIDlet suite. When the AMS can authenticate the
  MIDlet suite, it MUST be considered authenticated for the purposes
  of this API. The authority for a signed MIDlet suite is the value of
  the Subject field of the signing certificate.
  An application gets the authority using the 
  {@link javax.microedition.content.ContentHandler#getAuthority
  ContentHandler.getAuthority} method.
  The format of the authority for X.509 certificates is defined
  by the MIDP Printable Representation of X.509 Distinguished
  Names as defined in class
  <code>javax.microedition.pki.Certificate</code>. </p>
