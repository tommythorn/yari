/**
 * Sends a Text or Binary message. The calling function does not have to worry about the
 * details of the underlying communication protocol (such as GSM 3.40, CDMA IS-637, or others).
 * To avoid blocking the Java VM for a long time, this method works asynchronously and
 * returns before the message is delivered to the network. The target's native platform
 * handles the whole communication session and returns the result via an asynchronous message
 * or callback function.
 *
 * @param msgType message string type:Text(0) or Binary(1)
 *                The target device should decide the DCS (Data Coding Scheme)
 *                in PDU according to this parameter and the  message contents.
 *                If  the target device is compliant with GSM 3.40, then for a Binary
 *                Message,  the DCS in PDU should be 8-bit binary.
 *                For a  Text Message, the target device should decide the DCS  according to
 *                the  message contents. When all characters in the message contents are in
 *                the GSM 7-bit alphabet, the DCS should be GSM 7-bit; otherwise, it should
 *                be  UCS-2.
 * @param address the target SMS address for the message. The format of the address
 *                is expected to be compliant with MSIDN, for example, +123456789
 * @param msgBuffer the message body (payload) to be sent
 * @param msgLen the length of the message body
 * @param sourcePort the sender's reply port number
 * @param destPort the receiver's port number
 * @param bytesSent The number of bytes sent is returned in this variable
 * @param pContext pointer where to save context of asynchronous operation.
 *
 * @return Returns <code>WMA_OK</code> when successful;
 *      <code>WMA_NET_WOULDBLOCK</code> if reinvocation is required to
 *      finish the operation;
 *      <code>WMA_ERR</code> on error.
